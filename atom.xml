<p>He&rsquo;ll be talking about time-saving and productivity tips and tools you can adopt
right now, no matter what platform or language you use.  Specifically, the talk will
demonstrate the benefits of improving your physical and mechanical activities while
developing software &ndash; from keyboard shortcuts to optimal displays &amp; lighting to
automation tooling. It draws heavily from Productive Programmer by Neal Ford.</p>

<p>Luke is a superstar and all around nice guy for the web and works for Mozilla. In addition to being very active in civic coding with Code for Tulsa, he also helps organize Tulsa Web Devs and Techlahoma Founation.  When not coding, Luke likes running, soccer and the Thunder.</p>

<p>This month Paul Lamb will join us to take a look at the reasons you&rsquo;d want to use Elixir &amp; Phoenix in your next project. For such a new language and framework, Elixir and Phoenix have taken off surprisingly quick. We&rsquo;ll look specifically at why this is happening, and where you want to be thinking about using it. There will be code exploring the similarities/differences between Ruby and Elixir with some basic functional programming concepts to ease the transition. Once you unlearn a couple of things, your Rails background will be quite useful for getting things up and running on Phoenix in almost no time. Since we&rsquo;re focusing on the &ldquo;why&rdquo;, this will be a great meeting to bring your manager to.</p>

<p>Paul Lamb is a fat, happy, photographer who has fed himself for 30 years as a computer guy. He also wrote this bio himself. ;)</p>

<p>Ruby is a sweet language, but it’s more than just syntax that makes it awesome. Ruby gives you the ability to write some really powerful code that other languages can’t do, things like modifying existing classes, accessing and modifying private instance variables, defining methods, gaining access to defined classes just by a string variable, and so much more, all at runtime!</p>

<p>Don’t believe it? Well come to this meeting! We’re gonna go through some powerful, interactive demos of how you can start metaprogramming in Ruby.</p>

<h2>About our speaker</h2>

<p>Aaron Krauss is the coolest developer in the world. Seriously. You all probably already know him as DHH’s go-to guy for consulting over framework architecture and Matz’s favorite developer on speed-dial, but did you know he’s also an avid tea drinker, beer brewer, and pun champion? Some people actually think he’s a robot, because he just seems programmed to be awesome.</p>

using this pattern at scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make this?&rdquo; Our manager slides over a screenshot from Tron/Oblivion/Any Sci-fi movie with a sticky note that says &ldquo;our data here&rdquo; and pitchs us an idea.</p>

<p>We are stuck between a cool idea and tons of unknowns. We know that the availability, accuracy, and nature of our data  will directly affect the quality and outcome of our project. So how do we begin developing? We fake it while we make it.</p>

<p>This is what the talk is about: the importance of developing with fake data, the types of data we can fake, and some useful strategies for getting up and running with fake data.</p>

<p>Ryan LaBouve makes Internet things. In addition to Ember.js he is passionate about Ruby, UX, usability, and accessibility.</p>

<p>He is madly in love with his wife Robyn and their daughter, the Wee Princess Amy.</p>

<p>When he is not at the keyboard you might find him reading books, playing music or making things. If you show up at his house he will feed you. If you invite him out to coffee he will gladly accept.</p>

<p>Join us for a round-table discussion on refactoring. The TDD round-table
went really well in September, and we&rsquo;re excited to try it again. We
want to hear your stories from the trenches of refactoring in real
codebases. How do you decide to refactor someting? Are there tools or
techniques that you find particularly useful? When do you attempt a
refactor? Is it part of your regular workflow, or do you stop the world
to refactor in isolation? Are things different for small refactorings vs
large ones?</p>

<p>We (the organizers) are also interested to hear what you&rsquo;d like to see
from the group in 2015. Our current (tentative) plans involve finding a
mix of local and regional speakers combined with some more virtual
presentations from Rubyists across the country. If you have topics that
you&rsquo;d like to hear about (or speak about!) let us know.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>December 11th Meeting</h3>

<p>Join us as our very own Aaron Krauss presents &ldquo;Building a Stand-alone RESTful API with Rails&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How can you go about supporting your Angular/Ember/Backbone app, iOS app, Android app, Windows phone app, Apple TV app, etc., all with a single back-end? Here&rsquo;s how: by breaking up your backend server into its own API service, and Rails is just the framework to help make it simple and awesome.</p>

<p>A popular trend today is to break up your application into different services, i.e. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). By building an API, not only can you support all of your related apps with this single service, but it also keeps your back-end incredibly simple, logical, and easily maintainable.</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;re going to live-code an entire MVC RESTful API, all the way from scaffolding some models to handling serialization, authentication, and more if we have time. There will be candy too for active members of the audience &ndash; so bring your questions!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecodeboss">Aaron Krauss</a> is a full-stack developer and Director of Awesome at Staplegun Design in OKC. Before he found the magic of open-source, he was sure to be a .Net developer &ndash; at least, that&rsquo;s what the 3 universities he attended made him think was the right path. Now he prefers to use languages like ruby, javascript, go, and sass, with tools like vim and tmux. He tries to do everything he can through the command line, which you&rsquo;ll certainly see during his presentation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>September 11th Meeting</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re trying something a little different this month! Instead of a
formal presentation from a single speaker, we&rsquo;re going to have a
round-table style discussion.  The topic will be &ldquo;Is TDD really dead?&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll
talk about various philosopies and approaches that are commonly taken
with automated testing. We&rsquo;ll discuss what to test, and what not to test, when in the dev cycle
tests should be written, when they should be run, how they affect
deployment, and how they affect development.  Come join in the
discussion!</p>

<p>This month we&rsquo;ll have a special guest presenting for us from Seattle.
<a href="http://twitter.com/mjkirk">Matt Kirk</a> will give us a dose of machine learning on the topic of building (and testing)
sentiment analysis using support vector machines in Ruby.  This is sure
to be an interesting session that you won&rsquo;t want to miss.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mjkirk">Matt</a> is the author of the upcoming O&#8217;Reilly book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thoughtful-Machine-Learning-Test-Driven-Approach/dp/1449374069">Thoughtful Machine Learning</a>.
(You can also <a href="http://signup.thoughtfulml.com/">sign up here to be notified when the book is released.</a>) He&rsquo;s
also a partner at <a href="http://modulus7.com/">Modulus 7</a>, a change management
consultancy in Seattle, WA.  When he&rsquo;s not teaching machines to
learn or people to change, you might find him travelling or enjoying (or expanding) his 2,000+(!!) collection of vinyl records.</p>

<p>This month, we&rsquo;re celebrating Railsconf by having our own Railsconf speaker Jeremy Green talk about Service Oriented Authentication. Getting started with authentication in SOA environments can seem like a daunting subject, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult. This talk will cover everything you need to know to get started building your own SOA systems. We&rsquo;ll look at the details of building a centralized authentication service and allowing other apps to delegate their authentication needs to the service.</p>

<p>Jeremy (<a href="https://twitter.com/jagthedrummer">@jagthedrummer</a> / <a href="http://www.octolabs.com">Octolabs</a>) is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He&rsquo;s an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.</p>
