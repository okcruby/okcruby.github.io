    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Metaprogramming in Ruby</h2>

<p>Ruby is a sweet language, but it’s more than just syntax that makes it awesome. Ruby gives you the ability to write some really powerful code that other languages can’t do, things like modifying existing classes, accessing and modifying private instance variables, defining methods, gaining access to defined classes just by a string variable, and so much more, all at runtime!</p>

<p>Don’t believe it? Well come to this meeting! We’re gonna go through some powerful, interactive demos of how you can start metaprogramming in Ruby.</p>

<h2>About our speaker</h2>

<p>Aaron Krauss is the coolest developer in the world. Seriously. You all probably already know him as DHH’s go-to guy for consulting over framework architecture and Matz’s favorite developer on speed-dial, but did you know he’s also an avid tea drinker, beer brewer, and pun champion? Some people actually think he’s a robot, because he just seems programmed to be awesome.</p>

<p>Service Oriented Architecture is a pattern of application design that has been
discussed and suggested as a solution to complex, interconnected, applications.
Join us as we discuss simple examples of how a small project could develop into
to a services based approach and what weaknesses and challenges arise when
using this pattern at scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make this?&rdquo; Our manager slides over a screenshot from Tron/Oblivion/Any Sci-fi movie with a sticky note that says &ldquo;our data here&rdquo; and pitchs us an idea.</p>

<p>We are stuck between a cool idea and tons of unknowns. We know that the availability, accuracy, and nature of our data  will directly affect the quality and outcome of our project. So how do we begin developing? We fake it while we make it.</p>

<p>This is what the talk is about: the importance of developing with fake data, the types of data we can fake, and some useful strategies for getting up and running with fake data.</p>

<p>Ryan LaBouve makes Internet things. In addition to Ember.js he is passionate about Ruby, UX, usability, and accessibility.</p>

<p>He is madly in love with his wife Robyn and their daughter, the Wee Princess Amy.</p>

<p>When he is not at the keyboard you might find him reading books, playing music or making things. If you show up at his house he will feed you. If you invite him out to coffee he will gladly accept.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>January 8th Meeting</h3>

<p>Join us for a round-table discussion on refactoring. The TDD round-table
went really well in September, and we&rsquo;re excited to try it again. We
want to hear your stories from the trenches of refactoring in real
codebases. How do you decide to refactor someting? Are there tools or
techniques that you find particularly useful? When do you attempt a
refactor? Is it part of your regular workflow, or do you stop the world
to refactor in isolation? Are things different for small refactorings vs
large ones?</p>

<p>We (the organizers) are also interested to hear what you&rsquo;d like to see
from the group in 2015. Our current (tentative) plans involve finding a
mix of local and regional speakers combined with some more virtual
presentations from Rubyists across the country. If you have topics that
you&rsquo;d like to hear about (or speak about!) let us know.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>December 11th Meeting</h3>

<p>Join us as our very own Aaron Krauss presents &ldquo;Building a Stand-alone RESTful API with Rails&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How can you go about supporting your Angular/Ember/Backbone app, iOS app, Android app, Windows phone app, Apple TV app, etc., all with a single back-end? Here&rsquo;s how: by breaking up your backend server into its own API service, and Rails is just the framework to help make it simple and awesome.</p>

<p>A popular trend today is to break up your application into different services, i.e. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). By building an API, not only can you support all of your related apps with this single service, but it also keeps your back-end incredibly simple, logical, and easily maintainable.</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;re going to live-code an entire MVC RESTful API, all the way from scaffolding some models to handling serialization, authentication, and more if we have time. There will be candy too for active members of the audience &ndash; so bring your questions!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecodeboss">Aaron Krauss</a> is a full-stack developer and Director of Awesome at Staplegun Design in OKC. Before he found the magic of open-source, he was sure to be a .Net developer &ndash; at least, that&rsquo;s what the 3 universities he attended made him think was the right path. Now he prefers to use languages like ruby, javascript, go, and sass, with tools like vim and tmux. He tries to do everything he can through the command line, which you&rsquo;ll certainly see during his presentation.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re trying something a little different this month! Instead of a
formal presentation from a single speaker, we&rsquo;re going to have a
round-table style discussion.  The topic will be &ldquo;Is TDD really dead?&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll
talk about various philosopies and approaches that are commonly taken
with automated testing. We&rsquo;ll discuss what to test, and what not to test, when in the dev cycle
tests should be written, when they should be run, how they affect
deployment, and how they affect development.  Come join in the
discussion!</p>

<h4>Sorry and hope to see you next month</h4>

<p>Interested in how you can take your ruby skills and get the #1 paid app in the Apple App Store? We are too! That is why we&rsquo;ve summoned Amir Rajan (<a href="http://amirrajan.net">b</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/amirrajan">t</a>) to talk about RubyMotion and his app &ldquo;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8">A Dark Room</a>&rdquo;.  Amir will show us the beauty and elegance of using ruby instead of objective-c to build your app as well as the meteoric rise of A Dark Room.</p>

<p>Amir (<a href="http://amirrajan.net">b</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/amirrajan">t</a>) is a polyglot superstar. Having cut his teeth in the deep waters of .Net, Amir has also sailed his code-ship into the watery regions of Nodejs, Ruby, objective C and others. Showing his commitment to okcruby, he will pack up nearly all of his possessions and travel to tell us about his odyssey with A Dark Room.</p>

<p>Location: <a href="http://www.exchangeokc.com/">The Exchange</a>
Time: 11:30 &ndash; 12:30</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>April 10th Meeting</h4>

<p>This month, we&rsquo;re celebrating Railsconf by having our own Railsconf speaker Jeremy Green talk about Service Oriented Authentication. Getting started with authentication in SOA environments can seem like a daunting subject, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult. This talk will cover everything you need to know to get started building your own SOA systems. We&rsquo;ll look at the details of building a centralized authentication service and allowing other apps to delegate their authentication needs to the service.</p>

<p>Jeremy (<a href="https://twitter.com/jagthedrummer">@jagthedrummer</a> / <a href="http://www.octolabs.com">Octolabs</a>) is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He&rsquo;s an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>February 13th Meeting</h4>

<p>Buckle up your SSH certs, because we&rsquo;re launching February with a talk on Capistrano.</p>

<p>Kelly Mahan is going to bring us the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>With our move to ruby and rails we needed a better way to deploy our applications to remote servers. Capistrano is a better way. I&rsquo;ll walkthrough a simple standard setup. Then I&rsquo;ll show off some of our more complex deployment scripts and automation. Finally I&rsquo;ll touch on some of the new stuff with Capistrano 3 and the direction that it is heading.﻿</p></blockquote>

<p>Kelly Mahan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kmahan">t</a>) will be the voice box for this talk. He&rsquo;s have been a professional web developer / jack of all trades for the past 16 years, but programming since way back when the TRS-80 and tape decks were all the rage. He started out with windows servers, asp, access databases, then picked up flash action-script and javascript to round out his interface skills. Around 2006 while working at Digimedia.com, the dev team made a group decision to learn Rails. Ruby is still his development tool of choice with Rails his goto for more complex web applications.</p>

actual number today was about 40, and everyone was very enthusiastic.<br/>
It&rsquo;s really awesome to see so much excitement in the local Ruby community.</p>
