###SOA: Tales from the Frontlines

This month Paul Dawson will be presenting "SOA: Tales from the Frontlines" on Thursday
April 9th.

Service Oriented Architecture is a pattern of application design that has been
discussed and suggested as a solution to complex, interconnected, applications.
Join us as we discuss simple examples of how a small project could develop into
to a services based approach and what weaknesses and challenges arise when
using this pattern at scale.

Paul is a relatively new developer with experience in in Ruby / Sinatra / Rails
(in that order). He spends his free time with
his family, riding his bike, and playing in Rust. He blogs sparingly at <http://cannot.into.computer>, which happens to be the greatest domain name ever.
