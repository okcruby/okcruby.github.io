### Lightning Talks

May is the month for Lightning Talks (at least this year). If you have something that you'd like to talk about for 5 or 10 minutes this is your chance.

We have [a new Meetup page where you can leave a comment with a brief description of the talk you'd like to do](http://www.meetup.com/OKC-Ruby/events/222346509/).

Or if you have an idea that you'd like to run by us for some feedback you can email us at team@okcruby.org.

Location: [Prototek][prototek]
Time: 11:30 - 12:30
