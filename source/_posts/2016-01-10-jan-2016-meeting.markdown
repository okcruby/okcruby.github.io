This month we're lucky to have Luke Crouch joining us from Tulsa.

He'll be talking about time-saving and productivity tips and tools you can adopt
right now, no matter what platform or language you use.  Specifically, the talk will
demonstrate the benefits of improving your physical and mechanical activities while
developing software - from keyboard shortcuts to optimal displays & lighting to
automation tooling. It draws heavily from Productive Programmer by Neal Ford.

Luke is a superstar and all around nice guy for the web and works for Mozilla. In addition to being very active in civic coding with Code for Tulsa, he also helps organize Tulsa Web Devs and Techlahoma Founation.  When not coding, Luke likes running, soccer and the Thunder.
