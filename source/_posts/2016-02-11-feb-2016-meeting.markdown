This month we have some of OKC's finest who were brave enough
to volunteer to speak on a randomly chosen topic, in no
particular order:

* David Roberts - Ruby On Windows
* Cort Spellman - Null Object Pattern
* Clayton Flesher - Refinements
* James Edward Gray II - Ruby 2.3
* Paul Dawson - Docker

'Popcorn talks' were created to help alleviate some of the
anxiety of topic selection and to give member's a chance
to present and learn about a topic they might not have
otherwise. Presentations can be a bit longer than a
traditional lightning talk, and topic choices were
suggested by the group and put into a bag to be chosen
by volunteers. This is OKC.rb's first attempt at hosting
these type of presentations, feedback (as always) is
welcome and encouraged.
