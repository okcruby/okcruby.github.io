Whether youâ€™re building a product using microservices or needing to
offload some long-running tasks, having a message broker to communicate
between different systems can be helpful. Using
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com), we will explore basic pub/sub and
work our way up to RPC. Besides covering the basics, we will show how
you can build more complex flows, check out a couple of useful plugins,
and compare using a message broker to some of the other
solutions currently available for Ruby.
