## Going Serverless

Serverless is a new framework that allows developers to easily harness AWS Lambda and Api Gateway to build and deploy full fledged API services without needing to deal with any ops level overhead or paying for servers when they're not in use. It's kinda like Heroku on-demand for single functions.

Jeremy Green is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He's an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.
