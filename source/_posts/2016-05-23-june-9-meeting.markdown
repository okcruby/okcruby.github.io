## Lightning Talks

We're doing lightning talks again in June. If you have something that you'd like to talk about for 5 or 10 minutes this is your chance.

Leave a comment [on our MeetUp event with a brief description of your idea to get on the lineup](http://www.meetup.com/OKC-Ruby/events/231340828/).

Or if you have an idea that you'd like to run by us for some feedback you can email us at team@okcruby.org.
