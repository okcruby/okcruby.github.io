## Show & Tell Talks

Come join us and tell us about something you've been doing or working
on. It could be a side project you're doing for fun, a side business
you're starting, or just a cool thing you've been toying with. Maybe
it's not even technical. Maybe you've been volunteering with an
organization that you'd like to talk about, or something like that. The
idea is to just share something to let the rest of the group know a
little more about you.

Each "Show & Tell Talk" should be around 6 minutes and can include some
slides and/or code samples if you'd like, or could be a walk through of
some software, or maybe just showing off a web site. It's your call.

You can sign up [at the MeetUp event for this meeting](http://www.meetup.com/OKC-Ruby/events/233438145/).

Many thanks to [Techlahoma](http://www.techlahoma.org/) for generously providing the materials for the meeting, including the food and chairs.
