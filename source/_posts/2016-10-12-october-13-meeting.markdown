## Product Planning Round Table

In this months round table discussion we'll talk about processes used to
plan and execute products. At your company are the developers involved
in deciding what to build? Are your customers? How do you decide what's
most important at any given time? How do you know when it's time for a
rewrite instead of something less drastic?
