## Adventures in testing a monolith

This month we'll hear from Jeremy Green about his recent experiences
working to speed up the test suite of a Rails monolith from 29 minutes
to around 9 minutes. Sometimes a
particular test is slow. But more often than not there are widely spread
inefficiencies that slow down your entire test suite. Learn how to
identify and tackle these types of problems to keep your tests running
quickly.

Jeremy ([@jagthedrummer][t] / [Octolabs][b]) is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He's an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.
