## DevOps Round Table

Join us this month for a round table discussion where weâ€™ll be discussing the current state of DevOps.
What exactly _is_ DevOps? Does it cover more than just
deployment strategies? What tools and processes are critical to your
implementation of DevOps? What are things that you think many people
overlook when it comes to DevOps?
