## Best Practices for Building a JSON API with Rails 5

A while back, Aaron gave a talk over building a basic JSON API with Rails where we covered some core API concepts. In this talk, we'll take those concepts to the next level and focus on 3 areas of best practice when building a JSON API:

* The JSON API spec
* Pagination
* Versioning

Don't worry - it's okay if you missed the original talk; we're gonna be building an API from the ground up so everyone will be on the same page. The whole talk will be live-coding with Rails 5; however, if you're unfamiliar with Rails (or even Ruby in general), the concepts we'll be covering are all language and framework agnostic, and you can apply them to any JSON API you build in any language.

This talk is part 1 of a 2-part series, and this talk helps set the stage for the next talk in March (where we'll tie this API up with Docker). You won't want to miss it!

Aaron Krauss is a developer at Clevyr where he builds data-driven applications in Ruby, Javascript, Go, and anything else awesome. He also blogs regularly, drinks beer, has a cool dog, and has been dating someone for over 10 years.
