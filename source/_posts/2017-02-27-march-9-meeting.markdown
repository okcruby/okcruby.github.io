## Running a Rails App with Docker

In the second part of this series, we'll be going over how to run our fancy new Rails API project with
Docker - and include with it some other neat services (such as background jobs and email sending) that will all communicate together. Docker is a tool which helps to standardize your dev environment (which helps both with deployment and with collaborative programming), and we're going to run all of our containers using Docker Compose. Even if you've messed with Docker in the past, you're still bound to learn something.

Don't worry if you missed the last talk - we'll do a quick catchup session before we start that'll cover everything you need to know!

Aaron Krauss is a developer at Clevyr where he builds data-driven applications in Ruby, Javascript, Go, and anything else awesome. He also blogs regularly, drinks beer, has a cool dog, and has been dating someone for over 10 years.
