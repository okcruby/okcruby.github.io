## An intro to Elixir and OTP for Rubyists

Elixir is a functional language that seems to be drawing many Rubyists away from their first love. It promises things like concurrency, fault tolerance, incredible performance, and more. One of the ways Elixir achieves this is by building on top of the Open Telecom Platform (OTP).

OTP is a collection of tools written in Erlang designed to give us this reliable and fast communication between processes. In this talk we'll look at the fundamentals of OTP and how "the Elixir way" helps us build well-architected, performant, and reliable software.

John Mosesman is an independent consultant and developer who would rather be in the woods and/or playing video games.
