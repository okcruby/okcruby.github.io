## Terraform 101

We all know the importance of managing our projects with git, allowing for collaboration, rollbacks and a viewable narrative around how we got to where we are today. Terraform is a tool that, among other things, allows us to do just that with our server infrastructure.

Clayton Flesher works at Hoegg Software, where he plays with a number of devops and integration tools, including Chef, Terraform and Mule on a variety of platforms. He also writes Ruby whenever he can get away with it.
