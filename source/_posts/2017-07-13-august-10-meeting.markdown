In August we'll be doing lightning talks. This is a great chance to do your first bit of public speaking, or to just share some interesting stuff you've been working on lately. Lightning talks should be 5-10 minutes long. Let us know what you'd like to talk about by leaving a comment [on the meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/OKC-Ruby/events/241690703/).
