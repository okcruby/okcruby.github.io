## Let's break code together

The most difficult problem in sofware development is people, and nowe're not talking about the users. It's us. In any collaborative projectcode reviews are a key part of the development process, but how can we knowif we're doing them effectively? Join us as we explore strategies for a moreproductive and enjoyable review process through embracing more failure andexperimentation.

Paul Dawson is a remote developer at Citrusbyte writing Elixir and Ruby.He is most often found on a bicycle, drinking coffee, and eating - but not usuallyat the same time.
