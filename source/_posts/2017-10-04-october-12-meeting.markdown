## Security Round Table

Equifax is leaking customer data; Yahoo updates its breach to include ALL users. What is a dev to do in this world? Join us as we have a round table discussion about all things security. What are we responsible for? How do we approach security (and don't say it's an ops problem)? And what we do to be more safe on the Internet?
