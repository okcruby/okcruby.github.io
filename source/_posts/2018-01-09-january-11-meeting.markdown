## The Odin Project: Advantages and Drawbacks of the Meta-Tutorial

A primer on a very comprehensive course on Ruby and the Rails framework.

Joe Lee is a self-paced web development student currently learning JavaScript and Ruby, who recently landed his first tech job thanks in no small part to his involvement with Techlahoma. His hobbies include video games and attempting to usurp the skeleton's place as StarSpace 46's mascot.
