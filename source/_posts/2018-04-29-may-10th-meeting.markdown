## The Future of OKC Ruby

Hey, everybody! Jeremy here.

You may have noticed a distinct lack of okc.rb meetings as of late. The story is that Paul, Rob and I have found ourselves consumed with other events lately and we just haven't been able to give the group the time and attention that it deserves.

We'd love to see the group continue, but we're going to need some help. We'd like to find some new co/organizers to help take the group through the next iteration.

If you're interested in getting involved as an organizer please join us on May 10th to learn what you can
do to help. If you're not quite ready for that commitment please come and help us unserstand what you'd like to see from the group moving forward.
